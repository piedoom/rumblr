Rumblr: A typed API client for Tumblr
--------------------------------

![Travis Badge](https://travis-ci.org/piedoom/rumblr.svg?branch=master)

Very much a work in progress!  Contributing is discouraged until the project goals solidify.

# Goal
The goal of `rumblr` is to become a mostly to fully featured Tumblr v2 API used for bots and user automation.  `rumblr` does not aim to implement an OAuth flow. 

# Examples
This was the first project I ever started in Rust, and docs aren't really up to par!  Expect better API documentation at a later date.  For now, take a look inside the examples folder or the integration tests folder for more details.
